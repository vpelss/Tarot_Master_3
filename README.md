# Tarot_Master_3

This script allows you to give Live Tarot Readings to your clients online.

Tarot Master 3 has an interface that does not require you to create individual spreads. This is a great time saver and enhances your clients Live Tarot Reading.

Our script will automatically fill in the card descriptions, which you can then modify. This is great for those new to reading Tarot cards!

You send the client their unique Session Code.
They see the spread unfold as cards are selected.
You do the readings live with the built in chat module, Google Talk or Skype if you prefer.

Any spreads is possible. If you create a new database you can use it for Rune readings, etc. You are only limited by your imagination.

You can also carry on multiple sessions at the same time.

It can be used to teach Tarot classes online.

The look is fully customizable by editing the HTML and CSS!

Compatible with IE6+ , Firefox , Chrome.
